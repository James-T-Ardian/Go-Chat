# Go-Chat
Repository that contains submodules that make up the Go-Chat website

Go-Chat website is currently in progress but a working prototype can be run in localhost

How to run locally: 
1. Make sure you have the appropriate versions for golang (1.18), npm (^8.3.1), and node (^18.12.1)
2. Clone this repository
3. Now you need two terminals, on one you run "cd Go-Chat-Server ; go run main.go"
4. On the other terminal you run "cd Go-Chat-Client ; npm install ; npm run start"
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/
6. You can test the functionality of Go-Chat by having multiple tabs of http://localhost:3000/ joining the same room and sending messages to one another
